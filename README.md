# OrcPlatformer

HOW TO MAKE THE ORC NOT GO THROUGH EVERYTHING:<br>
-Set the orc's collider to isTrigger.
-Make a new empty gameObject.
-Make this gameObject a child of the orc, and then drag it over to the orc in the scene.
-Give the empty gameObject a 2D box collider, and then edit the collider so that it is slightly smaller than the orc's collider. DON'T make this one a trigger.
